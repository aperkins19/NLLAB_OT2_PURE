This guide will walk you through how to perform OD600 measurements of the overnight cultures of the PURE system.

## Materials

#### Download

Download the repository by opening a terminal or command line, navigating to your desired folder on your local machine or the OT2 machine.  
Use the Change Directory command. An example is given below but use your folder of choice:

#### The Files

You should see the following files, this contains everything you need to perform the OD600 dilutions with the OT2, reading the plate with the Biotek H1 plate reader and the analysis.

* file 2


## Setting up the OT2

I hope this document provides all the information you need but feel free to ask a lab member at any point if you're unsure.

First, turn on the OT2 and login to the computer. Please ask a lab member for the password.
